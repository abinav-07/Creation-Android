# Creation-Android
This application was my final application created for my Android Certificate. 
This application uses Firebase, APIs, network verifications and Environmental datas.
This application has a navigation drawer for a Chat Activity based on Location of the User, a Horoscope Activity and an Activity made with the idea of a flip book.
